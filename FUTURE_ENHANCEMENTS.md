## Notes

These enhancements represent the next evolution of the Athena library. While the current implementation is production-ready, these features would position Athena as a leading deep learning framework for both research and production use cases.

Priority should be given to features that:
1. Have strong user demand
2. Provide significant performance improvements
3. Enable new use cases
4. Improve developer experience
5. Build community engagement
