- ✓ Missing imports for Activation
- ✓ argmax() helper function added (ndarray doesn't have this method)

- ✓ Generic agent traits (RLAgent, ValueBasedAgent, PolicyBasedAgent, ActorCriticAgent)
- ✓ Adapter pattern for existing agents

## Why This Order?

1. **Foundation First**: Restructuring the codebase and implementing proper traits/types prevents massive refactoring later
2. **Core Before Features**: Getting DQN working properly with clean APIs makes adding features straightforward
3. **Features Before Optimization**: No point optimizing code that might change
4. **Testing After Features**: Test the complete feature set, not intermediate states
5. **Documentation Last**: Document the final, stable API

## Parallel Work Opportunities

While following the main sequence, these can be done in parallel:
- Documentation can be updated incrementally
- Examples can be created as features are added
- Performance benchmarks can be set up early
- CI/CD pipeline can be configured anytime

## Key Principles

1. **Make Breaking Changes Early**: API changes in Phase 1 prevent downstream rework
2. **Group Related Changes**: Implement all optimizers together, all layers together
3. **Test as You Go**: Add tests for each new feature immediately
4. **Maintain Backwards Compatibility**: After Phase 1, try to keep existing APIs working
5. **Document Incrementally**: Update docs with each change

## Expected Outcomes

- Clean, modular architecture
- Type-safe, consistent APIs  
- Comprehensive feature set
- Excellent performance
- Full test coverage
- Complete documentation
- Production-ready library

This approach minimizes rework, ensures each phase builds on a solid foundation, and delivers a professional-quality library efficiently.
