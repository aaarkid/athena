Yes, this is the current list of structs and their associated methods in your project. It's a good starting point for a simple DQN implementation. As mentioned before, you can improve the training algorithm with techniques like mini-batching, advanced optimization algorithms, regularization, learning rate scheduling, and early stopping.

You may also want to consider other improvements to the overall implementation:

    Add a save and load functionality for the NeuralNetwork struct so that you can save the trained model to a file and load it later for further training or evaluation.

    Implement a method to evaluate the performance of the DqnAgent on a test set. This can help you track the agent's learning progress and decide when to stop training.

    Enhance the DqnAgent struct to include more advanced exploration strategies like epsilon-greedy, Boltzmann exploration, or upper confidence bound (UCB) exploration.

    In replay_buffer.rs, consider implementing a more advanced replay buffer such as a prioritized experience replay buffer, which samples experiences based on their importance for training.

    Add support for more activation functions like Sigmoid, Tanh, and Leaky ReLU in the Activation enum.

    Create a command-line interface or a simple GUI for configuring, training, and evaluating the DQN agent.

    Sure, here's an explanation of these concepts without code:

    Regularization: Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting in machine learning models. Overfitting occurs when the model performs well on the training data but generalizes poorly to unseen data. Two common types of regularization are L1 and L2 regularization.

    L1 regularization (Lasso): Adds the absolute values of the model's weights multiplied by a regularization parameter (lambda) to the loss function. This encourages sparsity in the model's weights, effectively removing some features by setting their weights to zero.
    L2 regularization (Ridge): Adds the squared values of the model's weights multiplied by a regularization parameter (lambda) to the loss function. This encourages the model to use smaller weights, making the model less sensitive to individual features.

    Learning rate scheduling: In gradient-based optimization algorithms, the learning rate determines the step size taken during each iteration to update the model's weights. A good learning rate allows the model to converge quickly without overshooting the optimal solution. Learning rate scheduling adjusts the learning rate during training based on a predefined schedule or rule. Some common learning rate schedules include:

    Exponential decay: The learning rate decreases exponentially over time.
    Step decay: The learning rate decreases by a factor after a fixed number of epochs.
    Cosine annealing: The learning rate varies periodically following a cosine function.

    Early stopping: Early stopping is another technique to prevent overfitting. It monitors the performance of the model on a validation set during training. If the validation performance does not improve (or worsens) for a specified number of epochs, training is stopped. This prevents the model from overfitting the training data by stopping training before the model starts to memorize the training data.

The key components of early stopping are:

    Validation performance: A metric (e.g., accuracy, loss) used to evaluate the model's performance on a validation set.
    Stopping criterion: The minimum improvement in validation performance required to continue training.
    Patience: The number of consecutive epochs without improvement in validation performance before stopping training.

By incorporating regularization, learning rate scheduling, and early stopping into your training process, you can improve the model's generalization to unseen data and prevent overfitting.
